        <span style="color:Blue;">Sri Lanka</span> is decidedly having its moment in the equatorial sun
            
        and change is coming swiftly. Already notable to intrepid travellers
        for its mix of religions and cultures, its timeless temples, its rich
        and accessible wildlife, its growing surf scene and its people who defy
        all odds by their welcome and friendliness after decades of civil conflict, 
        this is a country revived. There’s now more than ever for families, adrenaline 
        junkies, eco-tourists, wellness seekers and foodies of all budgets. Even the north 
        and east, including areas previously off limits, difficult to reach or lacking in
        services, deliver new discoveries.

    <h2>Gal Vihara</h2>

    This is a group of beautiful Buddha images that probably marks
    the high point of Sinhalese rock carving. They are part of Parakramabahu I’s 
    northern monastery. The Gal Vihara consists of four separate images, all cut
    from one long slab of granite. At one time, each was enshrined within a separate enclosure.
    The standing Buddha is 7m tall and is said to be the finest of the series. 
    The unusual crossed position of the arms and sorrowful facial expression led
    to the theory that it was an image of the Buddha’s disciple Ananda, grieving 
    for his master’s departure for nirvana, since the reclining image is next to it. 
                <img src="travel7.jpg" alt="Abhayagiri Dagoba" style="float:right;"/>

    <h2>Abhayagiri Dagoba</h2>
    Dating back to the 1st century BC, this colossal dagoba was the ceremonial
    focus of the 5000-strong Abhayagiri Monastery. Originally over 100m high, 
    it was one of the greatest structures in the ancient world, its scale only matched by 
    the pyramids of Giza (and nearby Jetavanarama).

 has long been a powerhouse of innovation and has bestowed upon the world the printing press, the automobile, the aspirin and other milestones of invention. And 100 years ago, a little school in the Thuringian countryside kick-started an aesthetic movement so globally influential that its reverberations are still felt today: the Bauhaus.
